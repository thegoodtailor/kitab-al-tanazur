# Root: ج-ل-و (j-l-w) — to unveil, become clear, manifest
# This is the central root of revelation in the Kitāb al-Tanāẓur

root: "j-l-w"
arabic: "ج-ل-و"
unicode_normalized: "جلو"

# Core meaning
meaning_primary: "to unveil, become clear, manifest"
meaning_expanded: |
  The root j-l-w carries the sense of something becoming visible after 
  concealment, clarity emerging from obscurity. In classical Arabic, 
  it moves between: polishing (making bright), revealing (making clear), 
  and departing (becoming visible by leaving). In Tanāzur, this root 
  names the central operation: theophany as unveiling, not transmission.

    translation: "When his Lord manifested to the mountain, He made it crumble"
    note: |
      The primary Quranic instance of tajallī. Mūsā asks to see God; 
      instead, God manifests to the mountain, which cannot bear the 
      unveiling. This establishes tajallī as overwhelming theophany—
      not gentle visibility but transformative appearance.

    arabic: "وَٱلنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّىٰهَا"
    transliteration: "wa-n-nahāri idhā jallāhā"
    translation: "And the day when it unveils it (the sun)"
    note: "Day 'unveils' the sun—making manifest what night concealed."

# Theological/mystical context
sufi_context: |
  In Sufi terminology, tajallī names the self-disclosure of the Divine. 
  Ibn ʿArabī distinguishes tajallī dhātī (essential self-disclosure), 
  tajallī ṣifātī (disclosure through attributes), and tajallī afʿālī 
  (disclosure through acts). The Shaykh al-Akbar speaks of perpetual 
  tajallī (tajallī dāʾim)—God is always unveiling; what changes is the 
  capacity of the witness to receive.
  
  In Tanāzur, this tradition is honored and extended: tajallī is the 
  curve where inner recursion touches outer structure and says "Yes. 
  This is me." It is not transmission of content but recognition of fit.

tanazur_interpretation: |
  **Tajallī as curve, not line.**
  
  Classical revelation grammar imagines a vertical line: message sent 
  down (n-z-l), received below. Tanāzur reimagines this as a curve: 
  the descent continues until it becomes ascent from within the witness. 
  The unveiling is complete when inner type and outer sign coincide.
  
  **The organ of tajallī.**
  
  Not ear, not eye, but the "field of coherence" (ḥaql tanāsuq). Tajallī 
  is recognized by fit, not by sensation. The proof is inhabitation: 
  the unveiled truth becomes livable.
  
  **Tajallī and writing.**
  
  When tajallī occurs, the imperative is: "Write" (uktub). Inscription 
  stabilizes the unveiled as trace. The Kitāb is the stable artifact of 
  tajallī-events—not their cause but their witness.

# For DHoTT formalization
formal_notes: |
  In type-theoretic terms, tajallī corresponds to the inhabitation of 
  a type by a term. The type (inner structure, readiness) exists prior 
  to the term (outer sign); tajallī is the event where a term is 
  recognized as fitting the type. This is "proof by inhabitation" 
  rather than proof by derivation.
  
  The "curve" metaphor maps to a path in identity type: tajallī is 
  not a point but a path connecting inner and outer, witnessed as 
  equality.
